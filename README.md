# ◆ OptimusCert

**A fancy, light-themed certification exam platform — powered by the OptimusDB engine.**

OptimusCert is a Microsoft-exam-style test platform with a timed **Exam mode**, a **Practice mode** with instant feedback, an admin studio to build exams (drag-and-drop builder), AI **and** rule-based PDF import, an analytics dashboard, printable certificates, and a portable `.cfexam` file format. It ships as two Docker containers — one `docker compose up` and it runs.

It comes pre-loaded with a real **65-question Microsoft AB-731 “AI Transformation Leader”** practice exam so you can try everything immediately.

> **Built on OptimusDB research.** OptimusCert is the applied result of research into **OptimusDB**, a small purpose-built data + assessment engine for testing platforms. See [About OptimusDB](#-about-optimusdb-the-engine) below.

## ✨ Highlights

**For candidates**
- **Exam mode** — timed, scored, auto-submit on timeout, question navigator, flagging.
- **Practice/Study mode** — check each answer as you go with instant feedback and explanations.
- Result screen with a pass/fail **score ring**, **per-domain performance**, and full answer review.
- A printable **Certificate of Achievement** on every pass (save as PDF from the browser).
- Catalog **search & filters** (by vendor / category).

**For admins**
- Create / edit / publish exams; **drag-and-drop question builder** with a template per type.
- **Import questions** from a PDF two ways: **AI extraction** (any layout, needs a key) or the **structured parser** (no key, for predictable dumps).
- **Analytics dashboard** — pass rate, average score, score distribution, accuracy by domain, and the hardest questions per exam.
- **`.cfexam`** export/import to back up, move, or share whole exams.

**Question types (all Microsoft-style):** single choice · multiple choice · drag-and-drop matching · Yes/No hotspot grids · fill-the-blank dropdowns.

## 🚀 Quick start (Docker Desktop)

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # then paste a random JWT_SECRET; add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY only if you want AI import
docker compose up --build
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** and sign in:

| Role      | Email              | Password   |
|-----------|--------------------|------------|
| Admin     | `admin@exam.local` | `admin123` |
| Candidate | `user@exam.local`  | `user123`  |

Stop with `Ctrl+C`, then `docker compose down` (`-v` also wipes the data volume).

## 🧠 Data backend — powered by OptimusDB

OptimusCert stores **all of its data in [OptimusDB](https://github.com/georgeGeorgakakos/optimusdb)** — the decentralized database (a SQL engine over SQLite, running on libp2p/IPFS) that this project’s research is based on. The backend talks to OptimusDB’s **SQL‑over‑HTTP** interface (`POST /swarmkb/command` with the `sqldml` command), so OptimusCert’s tables live in **OptimusDB’s SQLite**, not a local file.

OptimusCert’s tables are namespaced with an **`oc_` prefix** (`oc_users`, `oc_exams`, `oc_questions`, `oc_attempts`) so they never collide with OptimusDB’s own internal catalog tables (OptimusDB already ships a `users` table for its DID/credentials system).

The data layer is pluggable via `DB_BACKEND`:

| `DB_BACKEND` | Behaviour |
|--------------|-----------|
| `optimusdb` *(default in compose)* | Every read/write runs as SQL against OptimusDB over HTTP. The schema and seed data are created there automatically on first run. |
| `sqlite` | Falls back to a local embedded SQLite file (no OptimusDB needed) — handy for offline dev. |

```
┌────────────┐   /api/*    ┌──────────────────┐   SQL over HTTP    ┌─────────────────┐
│ OptimusCert│ ───────────▶│ OptimusCert API  │ ─────────────────▶ │    OptimusDB    │
│  React SPA │ (nginx px)  │ Node/Express     │  POST /swarmkb/    │  SQL engine ─▶  │
│  nginx :80 │             │ grading·analytics│  command (sqldml)  │     SQLite      │
└────────────┘             └──────────────────┘                    └─────────────────┘
   :8080 host                                                     :8089 (in compose)
```

The app still owns the **typed question model** (one canonical JSON shape per type), the **deterministic grading core** (`services/grading.js`, shared by exam submit, practice checks, and analytics), and the **attempt‑analytics** rollups — but persistence is delegated to OptimusDB.

### Migrating existing data into OptimusDB

If you already ran on the `sqlite` backend and want to move that data over, a one‑shot tool extracts everything from the local SQLite and loads it into OptimusDB’s SQLite:

```bash
cd backend
OPTIMUSDB_URL=http://localhost:18089 npm run migrate:optimusdb
# add MIGRATE_WIPE=1 to clear the OptimusDB tables first
```

It creates the schema, copies `users / exams / questions / attempts`, then verifies row counts on both sides.

> **Validation note.** The OptimusDB driver, the migration tool, and the full app flow (seed → take exam → grade → analytics) were verified end‑to‑end against a stand‑in that reproduces OptimusDB’s real `sqldml` response envelope — SELECT rows arrive wrapped as `{ "status": 200, "data": { "records": [ … ] } }`, which the driver unwraps. The `sqlite` backend remains a guaranteed‑working fallback via `DB_BACKEND=sqlite`.

## 📚 Exam vs Practice mode

![Practice mode feedback](docs/screenshots/04-practice-feedback.png)

- **Exam mode** runs a countdown from the exam’s duration and auto-submits when time expires. Answers stay hidden until you finish.
- **Practice mode** is untimed (it shows elapsed time). A **Check answer** button reveals whether each answer is correct, highlights the right answer, and shows the explanation — and the navigator turns green/red as you go.

Both use the identical OptimusDB grading core, so practice results and exam results are consistent.

## 📄 Importing questions

![Import wizard](docs/screenshots/09-import.png)

On **Admin → Import**, pick a method:

- **🤖 AI extraction** — handles messy/mixed layouts and every question type. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`.
- **📐 Structured parser** — no key needed; for files that follow the common dump layout (numbered questions, `A`–`D` options, an `Answer:` line). Two+ answer letters become multiple-choice automatically. The exact format is shown in the UI.

You review and pick which extracted questions to keep before saving into a new or existing exam.

> The bundled **AB-731** exam was produced with this pipeline: 50 of 65 questions parsed straight from the PDF text, and the 15 image-based hotspot/drag questions reconstructed and verified. All 65 grade correctly.

## 📊 Analytics & 🏆 certificates

![Admin analytics](docs/screenshots/08-analytics.png)

Admins get a live analytics dashboard: platform totals, recent activity, and per-exam pass rate, average score, score distribution, accuracy by domain, and the hardest questions. Every candidate who passes can open and print a **Certificate of Achievement**:

![Certificate](docs/screenshots/06-certificate.png)

## 💾 The `.cfexam` file format

Any exam exports to a single portable file (**Admin → Export .cfexam**) and re-imports on another install (**Import .cfexam**). It’s readable JSON under the `optimuscert-exam` schema (older `certforge-exam` files are still accepted). A copy of the AB-731 exam ships as `AB-731_AI_Transformation_Leader.cfexam`.

---

## 🛠 Local development (without Docker)

```bash
# OptimusDB API
cd backend && npm install
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... npm run dev        # http://localhost:4000

# Web app
cd frontend && npm install
npm run dev                                      # http://localhost:5173 (proxies /api → :4000)
```

## 🔒 Notes
- Change `JWT_SECRET` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` before any real deployment.
- Login sessions are in memory, so a browser refresh signs you out (expected for this build).
- The bundled dump is third-party study material included for demonstration; verify answers against official Microsoft documentation.
- Grading is all-or-nothing per question; partial-credit hooks live in `backend/src/services/grading.js`.
